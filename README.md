# Matrix

**By Will Rosenberg and Aroon Sankoh**

Class implementing matrices in C++. We implement basic matrix operations such as *addition, multiplication, row reduction and more* using matrix objects represented by a 1D array. Note that all of our operations are cache-efficient, as in they can be computed on systems with extremely inefficient caching. 

This project is best run on CLion, in which case please import the entire library. If run on other IDE's, only import the src and README files.
