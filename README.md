**By Will Rosenberg and Aroon Sankoh**

Class implementing matrices in C++. We implement basic matrix operations such as *addition, multiplication, row reduction and more* using matrix objects represented by a 1D array. Note that all of our operations are cache-efficient, as in they can be computed on systems with extremely inefficient caching.
